# Description
Run openmrs reference application and mysql as disposable docker containers
for demo server.

The docker image used was generated by OpenMRS SDK, and deployed to Docker hub (check <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmrs/openmrs-distro-mdsbuilder/>

## Building and deploying new version

Edit <https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-ansible-docker-compose/blob/master/files/mdsbuilder/openmrs-distro.properties>

Use <https://ci.openmrs.org/browse/OENV-DM> to create image, push to docker hub and the server. 

## Running it locally

To start both containers:
```
$ BACKUP_DIR=./backups docker-compose down -v
$ BACKUP_DIR=./backups docker-compose up
```

Use _CTRL + C_ to stop it all containers. But make sure to destroy containers to delete any
left overs volumes and data when doing changes to the docker configuration and images:

```
$ BACKUP_DIR=./backups docker-compose down -v
```
