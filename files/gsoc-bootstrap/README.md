# Description
Run openmrs reference application and mysql as disposable docker containers
for gsoc-bootstrap-refapp server.

The docker image used was generated by OpenMRS SDK, and deployed to Docker hub (check <https://hub.docker.com/r/openmrs/openmrs-reference-application-distro/>

This docker compose was copied from demo (check its readme for details on how to run it locally).

Will be using the docker image with tag uat since this server don't need to be included on the ci process.And will be removed when the GsOC 19 project is done.
